# Lethal Debt

Have you ever wanted to make some questionable financial decisions? Spend more money than the game allows you to?

With this mod, you'll be able to do just that. It allows you to go into the negatives by purchasing things you can't afford, no matter how expensive. Wanna go to Artifice on your first run? No problem!

This doesn't come without consequences however. If you don't repay your debt by the end of a quota, you can say goodbye to your ship.

While this mod is technically client sided, **clients who join lobbies whose host does not have the mod won't be able to overspend in any way**.
